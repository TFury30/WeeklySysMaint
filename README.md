## Setup and Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository**

   * Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TFury30/WeeklySysMaint.git
   ```

2. **Modify the Script**

   * Open the script in a PowerShell editor and update the following variables to suit your system:

     * Backup paths (`$sourcePath`, `$backupPath`)
     * Email server details (`$smtpServer`, `$smtpFrom`, `$smtpTo`, etc.)
     * Paths to tools like Malwarebytes and Windows Defender (if needed).

3. **Schedule the Script**

   * You can schedule this script to run automatically using Windows Task Scheduler:

     * Open **Task Scheduler**.
     * Click **Create Task** and set the trigger to run weekly.
     * Set the action to execute `powershell.exe` and pass the script path as an argument.

4. **Run the Script**

   * Run the script manually in PowerShell to ensure it works as expected:

   ```bash
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\script.ps1"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start Weekly Maintenance**:

   * The script can be run manually or scheduled using Task Scheduler.
   * It will log activities, install updates, perform system checks, clean old files, run scans, and more.

2. **Logs**:

   * All activities are logged to a specified log file (`maintenance_log.txt`), which can be reviewed for audit purposes.

3. **Error Handling**:

   * If an error occurs during the update process, the script will prompt you to restore the system using a previously created restore point.
   * You will also be notified by email and SMS if critical errors are detected.

## Example Task Scheduler Setup

If you'd like to schedule this script to run every Monday at 2 AM, you can use the following command in PowerShell to create a scheduled task:

```powershell
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell.exe" -Argument "C:\path\to\script.ps1"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday -At 2AM
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -TaskName "Weekly System Maintenance"
```

## Customization

### Backup

The script currently performs a full backup of your Documents folder. You can customize the backup location and add more folders as necessary.

### Email/SMS Alerts

To receive email and SMS alerts, configure the `$smtpServer`, `$smtpFrom`, and `$smtpTo` variables in the script. You may also need to modify the email-to-SMS gateway for SMS alerts.

### Disk Space and CPU Monitoring

The script checks for low disk space (less than 10 GB) and monitors CPU and memory usage. You can adjust the thresholds as needed for your environment.
